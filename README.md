Leto is a library for developing modular and stable software in C language

# How it works?

The library is currently under development and will include:
+ `DONE` **leto-list** — Singly Linked List Library
+ `DONE` **leto-error** — Error and warning handling library
+ `DONE` **leto-test** — Library for simple unit testing
+ **leto-so** — Library for working with dynamic libraries
+ **leto-utsf** — Data transfer and storage library
+ **leto-module** — Library for working with program modules

# How to use it?

How you use the library is up to you, but I recommend statically linking it to your program.
Additional information will appear when I complete the library.

# How to compile it?

Use any C compiler with C11 support.
